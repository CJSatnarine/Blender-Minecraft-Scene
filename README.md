# :question: About
Initially, this was a project where I planned to learn how to script using the Blender Python API by "procedurally" generating a world (similar to Minecraft). Now, it's just a little project where I make a tiny scene with a tree and some decorations randomly place across the scene.

# :hammer_and_wrench: Running the Script
I guess just copy the script and paste it in the Blender Scripting Workspace.
